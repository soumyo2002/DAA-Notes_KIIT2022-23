A1)FINITE set of steps to solve a problem is called an algorithm. No of steps and instruction should be finite.

A2)Characteristics:
i)Algorithm must execute in finite number of steps
ii)Each step must be clear and unambiguous
iii)Feasibile:Should work within the given resources
iv)Language independent
v)Algorithm must take zero or more inputs and produce atleast one output and algorithm must specify what output will be produced

A3)Analysis is comparison of two algorithms w.r.t time and space.

priori algorithms are absolute algorithms whose analysis is done before running it on the system and
whose efficiency is calculated in asymtotic terms and is independent of language and hardware whereas, 

Posteriori algorithms are relative algorithms whose analysis is done after running it on the system and
whose efficiency is not calculated in asymtotic terms and is dependent on language and hardware.

A4)
Adavantages:
1)Easier to understand
2)Gives step-wise solution to the problem
3)Can be converted to program easily as big problem is broken down into smaller steps

Disadvantages:
1)Complex logic is difficult to understand through algorithms
2)Time-consuming
3)Branching and looping is very difficult to represent in algos(IMP)
